# FAQ


### How do I begin roleplaying on Kinkdom?

Firstly, please read the [rules](https://github.com/kinkdom-org/community/blob/main/rules.md) before jumping in. After getting your introduction approved, you may leave a post in one of the partner search channels. You will find these in the category named `PARTNER SEARCH`. If you see someone else with a post that looks interesting, you should contact them in DMs.
All the public roleplay channels are open for anyone to use. You can write a starter post in a channel that's available, or join an ongoing roleplay after making sure the other participants are ok with it.


### What are gems (ðŸ’Ž)?

Gems are the official currency of Kinkdom. They can be earned by participating throughout the server, and used to trade items and services in the `#card_marketplace`, as well as to upgrade vanity roles. To check your balance, type /gems in `#bot_commands`. To upgrade your vanity role, type /upgrade when you have the sufficient amount of gems.


### What is x channel for, and how is it used?

If you are unsure about the purpose of a channel, you can find a short explanation in the channel topic. Gem income (if any) will also be listed here. More useful info can usually be found in the pinned messages.


### What if I don't want others to read my roleplay?

In addition to direct messages (DM's), we provide private channels that players can reserve for an amount of time. Message a mod to request access to a room if you and a partner are interested in making use of one. While in a private room, you continue to earn gems. The room's message history will then be reset after you finish your session.


### Can I apply for a position on the staff team?

No. We are always looking for new staff members, however, our Operators are carefully chosen based on many factors. If you wish to join the staff, we encourage you to be active, as well as mindful around others. Important: Do not act as a mod. Controlling the server is the staff's job, and you will therefore be met with a notice. Asking to be considered for the role will likely decrease your chances.


### What are the requirements for a server partnership?

We currently do not have an established set of requirements. Instead, each situation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Servers with overlapping audiences and a higher amount of users (2000+ at least) are more likely to be considered. If you believe a server you are involved with at management level would be a good candidate, please get in touch with one of our admins.


### Can I donate to the server?

Yes! Visit our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/KinkdomERP)
The site and the server bots come with a series of expenses, so any donation is very much appreciated, and will help us out greatly! It will allow us to keep improving our services. Note: All donations received through our Patreon will be spent on the server.


### Can I invite my friends?

Yes! You can share this invite link: https://discord.gg/xa6erkM
