# Rules

The following list of rules are present to keep the server intact. We ask you to read through it carefully, as it will lay out a foundation to go about. If you're experiencing issues within the server, please contact the staff ( **Admin** / **Moderator** / **Operator** ) for assistance.

Abuse of the rules and guidelines is not allowed. Noncompliance, backtalk, and arguing semantics of a rule will likely result in a heavier penalty.

Breaking any of these rules may result in one of the following: `Notice`, `Warning`, `Mute`, `Ban`.


### 1. General Rules

> **a.** The age limit is strictly 18+. This server is oriented around adult content. If you are found to be underage, you will be indefinitely suspended from the server.

> **b.** This server is for written roleplay. If you are found to be here with the wrong intentions (e.g. looking for hook-ups/nudes/sexting/camming), you may face a permanent ban.

> **c.** Comply with Discord's Guidelines and ToS. Should you fail to follow these terms you will be removed from the server and reported to the Discord Team.

> **d.** Abusing the server / bot features for personal gain is not allowed. This includes gem farming, posting unoriginal roleplay, the use of alt accounts, etc. Alt accounts must be granted by a member of staff, and should only be used for roleplay.

> **e.** Do not take advantage of the server to advertise other servers. This server is for roleplay, not for networking. You may gather people for a group roleplay with the use of our partner search channels, so long the server has 10 users or less.

> **f.** Do not ask for a role within staff. Operators are chosen by the staff through a thorough discussion. Asking will likely decrease your chance in the future.

> **g.** Server vanity roles will not be reassigned should you leave the server without proper arrangement with staff.


### 2. Behaviour

> **a.** In order to keep the community clean and mature, we ask you not to spam. Spam includes sending similar messages multiple times, using abnormal characters, excessive capitalization, mass mentioning, or anything that is hard on the eyes.

> **b.** The server topics are to be taken seriously. Trolling will result in an instant and permanent ban.

> **c.** Do not aim to provoke another user on the server. This includes, but is not limited to, racism, kink-shaming, offensive jokes, slandering, and sexual harassment. Please respect one another and consider your messages twice before sending.

> **d.** Do not tease or taunt another user by bringing up their blacklisted topics or showing taunting content.

> **e.** Do not ask other users to send, post, or exchange pictures or identifying information of themselves. No means no.

> **f.** Do not send unsolicited images of yourself or pornographic content to other users in DMs.

> **g.** Do not contact other users in DMs before being approved on the server. If approved, do not contact Uncharted users in DMs before they are approved.


### 3. Content

> **a.** Server-wide banned topics: (These topics cannot be shared, discussed or found anywhere within our domain.) 
> 
> - Child porn / underage content
> - Real-life rape / abuse
> - Real-life bestiality / animal abuse

> **b.** Blacklisted in chat & public rp channels: (These topics should only take place in their dedicated categories or in a private setting.) 
> 
> - Dark themes
> - Bestiality
> - Toilet themes
> - Other extreme topics

> **c.** Blacklisted in image channels:
> 
> - Gore and other dark themes
> - Toilet themes
> - Other unpleasant/extreme/shocking imagery

> **d.** Blacklisted in nsfw/porn channels:
> 
> - Nudes of the person posting (you).
> - Regular day photos from social media / photos not intended to be in the context of pornographic content. 


### 4. Roleplay

> **a.** All roleplay is meant to be sincere. Unserious roleplay is considered trolling. For purpose of this server, sincere roleplay would include one or more partners. Any roleplay or literary work done by only one party is not subject to gem gain and should be posted in #art.

> **b.** If you wish to join in on an ongoing roleplay, please do so in a reasonable manner. Remember, simply asking to join is always a respectable solution!

> **c.** You are limited to two posts throughout any partner search channel per day.

> **d.** Godmodding, powergaming, and metagaming is not allowed. This means that you cannot control another person's character without their consent, perform unrealistic actions, or take use of knowledge that your character does not have.

> **e.** All characters must be 18+ years of age, and have the appearance of an adult.


**The rules act as guidelines. The staff will exercise their right to remove unwanted content and users to ensure a safe and healthy community.**
